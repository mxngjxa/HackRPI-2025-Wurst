This is a test document for the LLM File-Based Chatbot preload functionality.

The preload script should be able to read this file, chunk it, generate embeddings, and store it in the database as a preloaded document that is available to all sessions.

This document contains multiple paragraphs to ensure proper chunking behavior. The chunking module will split this text into overlapping segments based on the configured chunk size and overlap parameters.

Preloaded documents are marked with is_preloaded=True and session_id=NULL in the database, which distinguishes them from session-specific documents uploaded by users.
